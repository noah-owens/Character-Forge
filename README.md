## About

Character Forge is an app for creating D&amp;D characters and NPCs based on a completely hands-off approach. Certain features may be specified, but it's never a requirement! Character Forge has been designed with accessibility and ease of use in mind, so that anyone on any system can install, run, and have a random character or NPC statblock ready to go at a moment's notice.

### Built With
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) (JDK 17)
- [IntelliJ IDEA 202.3.4](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/IntelliJ+IDEA+2020.3.4+(203.8084.24+build)+Release+Notes) (This version is bundled with the lombok plugin)
- [Gluon Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/)

## Getting Started

Until I reach my first production release, I will not be providing a JAR. That doesn't mean you can't try it out though! To install the program, first open your terminal and clone the repository to your machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/noah-owens/Character-Forge.git
```

Next, make sure you have an up-to-date [Gradle installation](https://gradle.org/install/) and [JDK](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/). Navigate to the project directory in your command prompt, then you're all good to build and run the app using Gradle:
```
gradle build
gradle run
```
