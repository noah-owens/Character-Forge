# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest! Character Forge is a personal passion project and learning experience, but I'd love your help to give it a bit more flavor!

Before contributing, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
The details of the document will be important should enforcement action be necessary, but in reality all you need to do is be kind!

## New Contributor Guide

For a baseline understanding of the project, take a look at the [README](./README.md) and [Project Summary](https://github.com/noah-owens/Character-Forge/wiki#project-summary)

## Issues

### Create a New Issue

If you have any thoughts, bug-reports, suggestions, etc., I would appreciate you taking the time to make a detailed issue!
Before creating an issue, please look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/noah-owens/Character-Forge/issues) to make sure you aren't submitting a duplicate
post.

## Pull Requests

This project attempts to follow a workflow known as [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) which you should be familiar with before making commits.

A pull request will never be denied solely on account of not using Github Flow principles, so you don't need to agonize over it if you have little
or no familiarity with the workflow. It's the ideas that matter, not the technique! (I also make a lot of mistakes even when I'm trying to stick to the system so...)
