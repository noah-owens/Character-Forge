### Json Help

For easy extensibility, this project mainly focuses on loading data from json files stored at ```app/src/main/resources/serialized-objects/[file-name].json```
Data stored here includes Classes; Races; First, Middle, and Last Names; Spells and more. I will try to serialize a few examples of each type
into a file so that there is an example to follow, but you are more than welcome to add new names, and help convert Player's Handbook concepts into json by directly editing those files.

First/Middle/Last Names are an especially easy place to start, since they are essentially just comma separated lists of strings. If you'd like to help out and get your foot in the door, consider adding a few names!

## Pull Requests

This project uses a workflow known as [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) which you should be familiar with before making commits.

A pull request will never be denied solely on account of not using Github Flow principles, so you don't need to agonize over it if you have little
or no familiarity with the workflow. It's the ideas that matter, not the technique!
