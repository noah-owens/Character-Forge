# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest! This is a personal passion project and learning experience, but all contributions (code and otherwise) are actively encouraged! 

Before contributing however, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
The details of the document will be important should enforcement action be necessary, but in reality all you need to do is be kind!

## New Contributor Guide

For a baseline understanding of the project, take a look at the [README](./README.md) and [Project Summary](https://github.com/noah-owens/Character-Forge/wiki#project-summary) 
on the Wiki.

## Issues

### Create a New Issue

If you have any thoughts, bug-reports, suggestions, etc., but would not like to make a code contribution, I would appreciate you taking the time to make a detailed issue!
Before creating an issue, please look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/noah-owens/Character-Forge/issues) to make sure you aren't submitting a duplicate
post.

### Solve an Issue

You can also trawl through [existing issues](https://github.com/noah-owens/Character-Forge/issues) to find one that interests you. I will likely not be assigning issues to anyone, 
since that seems like a technique one would use with a slightly bigger team of dedicated developers. If you would like to solve an issue, you're welcome to open a Pull Request
that fixes it!

## Pull Requests

This project uses a workflow known as [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) 
which you should be familiar with before making commits. I have recently learned that Gitflow is basically considered an outdated strategy at this point, and may look at 
changing to a trunk-based workflow in the near future.

A pull request will never be denied solely on account of not using Gitflow principles, so you don't need to agonize over it if you have little
or no familiarity with the workflow. It's the ideas that matter, not the technique!

*This is a living document: as long as it refers to Gitflow, that is the workflow I will continue to prioritize.*
